# IHA_BLE_LIB
BLE project for IHA 

This project has 2 folders. A safe solution which will work, but is slower.
The other project is a little hack to make the last windows update work with BLE_Callback, which is ALOT faster but if changes happens to ble library it might have an impact.
To get the DLL, build the project and find it in the debug/release folder. 
The DLL found in the outter folder should always be the newest DLL version of the latest build with the latest changes. But make the DLL youself to always be sure to have the latest version.
